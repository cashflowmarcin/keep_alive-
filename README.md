# keep_alive-
This plugin keeps your Pwnagotchi connected to your iPhone hotspot by sending periodic pings to a specified website (e.g., google.com). It prevents iOS from disabling the hotspot after inactivity, which is a common issue due to Appleâ€™s battery-saving behavior. Simply configure the interval and target URL in your Pwnagotchi setup, and the plugin takes care of the rest.
